Programs: 
1. baseline.py
    - Problem Solved: This is a simple sentiment analysis program. It is implemented with a bag-of-words approach that utilizes binary vector  feature sets. The sentiment analysis is performed with Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine classifiers.
    - How to Run: 
        1. Python should be installed and on the path.
        2. Nltk must be installed for python (word tokenize, punckt, and stopwords must be downloaded)
        3. Navigate to the directory which contains the program.
        4. Run the program by typing "python baseline.py" into the terminal
        5. Metrics for each machine learning classifier will be printed to the console
        6. This program may take up to 10 minutes to complete -- it will provide you with periodic updates about the cureent status of the program.
